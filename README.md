## Before hackathon:
Satelite code: https://github.com/DaniielZ/meteocs-cansat

## Inspiration
ESA Cansat and current worldwide satellite situation.

## What it does
It's an independent Nano-satellite network which can provide live data, dodge jamming attempts from enemy countries and provide accurate information using triangulation.

## How we built it
We built the nano-satellite at the ESA Cansat event and added more features at the raccoons hackathon, which is shown in our pitch but includes a website and market research.

## Challenges we ran into
Figuring out the market, resolving problems with how live data will be gathered and other technical issues.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The satellite is ESA certified and working, the website for it is working and looks incredible, we got out first client.

## What we learned
We learnt more about or competitors and mistakes as well as more about space tech and the space market overall.

## What's next for LATSAT
Finishing the current prototype, creating a space ready prototype, launching it into space.
